# Startover

Startover is a boilerplate for creating static websites using html5, Compass (SASS) and jQuery. With Startover you don't have to start over!

## Another boilerplate?

I agree! We really don't need more boilerplates or frameworks for developing websites. Startover relies heavily on the works
of others like [html5boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/). However none of the boilerplates I've stumpled upon have
been quite right for me. I like things minimal and agile. This is why **Startover is not for everyone**. I created Startover
to fit my workflow with the tools I frequently use when developing websites.
